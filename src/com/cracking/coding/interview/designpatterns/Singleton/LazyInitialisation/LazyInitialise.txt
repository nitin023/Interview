3. Lazy Initialization

Lazy initialization method to implement Singleton pattern creates the instance in the global access method.

The above implementation works fine in case of the single-threaded environment
but when it comes to multithreaded systems,
it can cause issues if multiple threads are inside the if condition at the same time.
It will destroy the singleton pattern and both threads will get the different instances of the singleton class.
